## Description:
This was a refactoring of the Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. Website. I went ahead and fixed all of the formatting issues in their html, fixed a broken link, got rid of some unnecessary lines of code, made some font elements more accessible to read, and commented in the CSS for better understanding of what each selector type is. In short, I did my best to leave their code better then I found it!
